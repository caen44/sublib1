#summary Instructions for building sublib1 in Visual Studio Express

= Introduction =

Currently this project consists of three parts. The most important is a small c code piece, sublib1, that extracts metadata from h264 files in mts or m2ts containers and returns a subtitle string to code that consumes it.

The second part is SubExtractor. It is a C# wrapper for sublib1 that uses Pinvoke to pull subtitles from h264/mts files. 

The third part is a simple GUI, SubMaker, that provides a trivial interface to the other parts.
