#summary Instructions for building sublib1 in Visual Studio Express

= Introduction =

Currently this project consists of three parts. The most important is a small c code piece, sublib1, that extracts metadata from h264 files in mts or m2ts containers and returns a subtitle string to code that consumes it.

The second part is SubExtractor. It is a C# wrapper for sublib1 that uses Pinvoke to pull subtitles from h264/mts files. 

The third part is a simple GUI, SubMaker, that provides a trivial interface to the other parts.

==Setting up Visual Studio Express to build sublib1==

1. Download the FFMPEG win32 shared and shared-dev from the following locations:

http://ffmpeg.arrozcru.org/autobuilds/ffmpeg/mingw32/dev/shared/ffmpeg-r26400-swscale-r32676-mingw32-shared-dev.7z

AND

http://ffmpeg.arrozcru.org/autobuilds/ffmpeg/mingw32/shared/ffmpeg-r26400-swscale-r32676-mingw32-shared.7z

#Extract the shared.dev file into any location on your HD.
#Download the sublib1 source from here. Open the solution file. You will need to edit the properties of the project to find the FFMPEG headers and .lib files that you just extracted.
#Right click on *sublib1* in the solution explorer and select *Properties*
